I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Statistics and Finance, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and am working towards my Ph.D. thesis under the direction of Professor Yaohua Wu and Associate Professor [Baisuo Jin](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jbs/). My research interests revolve around a variety of topics in High-dimensional statistical learning, model selection, change point, functional/spatial data analysis, precision (personalized) medicine.

Previously, I studied at School of Mathematics, south China University of Technology, where I completed my Bachelor's degree (in 2012).
